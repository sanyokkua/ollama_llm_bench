  question: |
    What specific nuclear reaction occurs in the core of a pressurized water reactor (PWR), and what are the exact chemical elements used as both fuel and moderator in this process?
  expected_answer:
    most_expected: |
      The nuclear fission of uranium-235 occurs in a PWR core. The fuel element is enriched uranium (U-235), and the moderator is ordinary (light) water (H2O).
    good_answer: |
      Uranium-235 undergoes fission; fuel is enriched uranium; moderator is light water.
    pass_option: |
      PWR uses uranium-235 fission, with uranium fuel and water moderator.
  incorrect_direction: |
    Naming incorrect isotopes, using heavy water instead of light water, or confusing fuel and moderator elements.
