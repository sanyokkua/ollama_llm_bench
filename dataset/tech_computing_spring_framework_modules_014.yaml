  question: |
    What are the four core modules that constitute the Spring Framework's essential architecture (excluding optional extensions), and what specific problem does each solve in enterprise Java development?
  expected_answer:
    most_expected: |
      1. Core Container - manages dependency injection and inversion of control.
      2. Spring AOP - provides aspect-oriented programming for cross-cutting concerns.
      3. Data Access/Integration - simplifies database interaction and transaction management.
      4. Web Module - supports web applications via MVC architecture and REST.
    good_answer: |
      Core Container (DI), AOP (cross-cutting), Data Access (DB + transactions), Web (MVC & REST).
    pass_option: |
      Spring's core modules handle DI, AOP, data access, and web development in Java enterprise apps.
  incorrect_direction: |
    Including non-core modules or vague/missing problem descriptions.
