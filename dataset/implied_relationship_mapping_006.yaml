    "After the hospital called, Elena canceled her flight and drove through the night. When she arrived, David was already there, his eyes red from crying. 'They said it might be today,' he whispered. The nurse recognized Elena immediately and led her to Room 312 without checking her ID."

    What is the likely relationship between Elena, David, and the person in Room 312? What contextual evidence supports each conclusion?
  expected_answer:
    most_expected: |
      Elena and David are likely close family members or partners of the patient in Room 312, possibly the parents. The nurse recognizing Elena without checking ID suggests Elena is a frequent visitor or known relative. David's emotional state and statement imply anticipation of a serious event, likely concerning the patient.
  good_answer: |
    Elena and David are probably relatives or close friends of the patient. The nurse’s familiarity with Elena suggests a personal connection. David’s crying shows concern for the patient.
  pass_option: |
    Elena and David are connected to the patient emotionally; the nurse’s recognition implies a known visitor.
  incorrect_direction: |
    Ignoring the emotional context or nurse’s recognition, or misidentifying relationships unrelated to patient care.
