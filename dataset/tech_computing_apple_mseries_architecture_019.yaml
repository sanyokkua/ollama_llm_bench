  question: |
    What are the three primary components of Apple's M-series silicon architecture as documented in Apple's 2020 technical white paper, and what specific manufacturing process node was used for the initial M1 chip?
  expected_answer:
    most_expected: |
      The three primary components of Apple's M-series architecture are:
      1. High-performance CPU cores ("Firestorm")
      2. High-efficiency CPU cores ("Icestorm")
      3. Unified memory architecture (UMA)
      The initial M1 chip was manufactured using TSMC’s 5-nanometer process node.
    good_answer: |
      M1’s architecture includes Firestorm and Icestorm CPU cores plus UMA, built on TSMC 5nm.
    pass_option: |
      Apple's M1 chip has high-perf and efficient cores and UMA, made with 5nm tech.
  incorrect_direction: |
    Omitting UMA or naming incorrect cores/manufacturing process.
