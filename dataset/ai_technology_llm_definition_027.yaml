  question: |
    What is the precise technical definition of a Large Language Model (LLM) according to the 2023 ACM Computing Classification System, and what specific parameter threshold distinguishes LLMs from smaller language models in academic literature?
  expected_answer:
    most_expected: |
      The 2023 ACM Computing Classification System defines a Large Language Model (LLM) as a neural network-based language model with more than 1 billion parameters, trained on extensive textual corpora using self-supervised learning.
    good_answer: |
      LLMs are language models exceeding 1 billion parameters, per ACM 2023 classification.
    pass_option: |
      Models over 1B parameters qualify as LLMs according to ACM 2023.
  incorrect_direction: |
    Incorrect parameter threshold or vague definition not matching ACM standards.
