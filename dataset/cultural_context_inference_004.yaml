    "During the business dinner in Tokyo, Kenji kept nodding while Mr. Thompson explained the proposal. When asked for his opinion, he said 'It may be difficult' and changed the subject. The American team left feeling confident about the partnership."

    Why was the American team mistaken in their confidence? Explain using Japanese business culture context. What specific phrase signaled disagreement?
  expected_answer:
    most_expected: |
      The American team misunderstood Kenjiâ€™s nodding as agreement, but in Japanese culture nodding often shows politeness or attentiveness, not necessarily consent. The phrase 'It may be difficult' was a polite way to express disagreement or reluctance without direct refusal. Changing the subject further indicated discomfort with the proposal.
  good_answer: |
    The Americans thought Kenji agreed due to his nodding, but in Japan nodding can mean politeness, not agreement. Saying 'It may be difficult' was a subtle rejection.
  pass_option: |
    The Americans misread polite gestures and indirect language as agreement; the phrase 'It may be difficult' hinted disagreement.
  incorrect_direction: |
    Assuming nodding means agreement, or ignoring cultural communication styles and indirect disagreement phrases.
