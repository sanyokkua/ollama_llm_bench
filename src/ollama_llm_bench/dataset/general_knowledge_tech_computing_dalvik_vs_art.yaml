  question: |
    What are the three fundamental technical differences between Dalvik Virtual Machine and Android Runtime (ART) regarding compilation approach, garbage collection, and application startup performance?
  expected_answer:
    most_expected: |
      1. Compilation: Dalvik uses Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation, whereas ART uses Ahead-Of-Time (AOT) compilation.
      2. Garbage Collection: ART features improved concurrent garbage collection with better pause time management compared to Dalvik’s simpler GC.
      3. Startup Performance: ART improves app startup times by precompiling bytecode, unlike Dalvik's runtime compilation causing slower startups.
    good_answer: |
      Dalvik uses JIT, ART uses AOT; ART has better garbage collection; ART improves app startup by precompiling code.
    pass_option: |
      Dalvik compiles at runtime; ART compiles ahead of time; ART has enhanced GC and faster app launch.
  incorrect_direction: |
    Mixing compilation methods, inaccurate garbage collection details, or ignoring performance differences.
